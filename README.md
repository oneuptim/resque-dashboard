# Angular Material 2 Start

- - -

###### Prerequisites

* `npm install`
* `ng serve`

###### Tutorial Layout

You will notice a few files/directories within this tutorial:

 1. `src/app` - This is where all of your application files will be created and edited.
 3. `src/assets` - This folder contains some tutorial-provided images and icons which are used by
    the application.

These folders and files will be used to guide you through the development process. By following
these tutorial steps, you will be very quickly introduced to the powerful features of Angular
Material.

We encourage you to walk through each step yourself and build the application from the ground up.
However, if you get stuck or want to start from a clean slate, each step has an associated Git tag 
that you can checkout to reset your code to match the start of the associated step in the tutorial.

If you have not completed a tutorial step and wish to jump to the next step, then run the 
following command to open a terminal menu. This menu allows you to easily switch between the tutorial 
steps. 

* `npm run workshop` (Only works if `material2-start` has been downloaded using Git)

> **Note:** In some of the Steps in this README, we have abbreviated some of the HTML or JavaScript
  in order to show what is being added or changed, so you may not be able copy & paste every example
  into your code. If you wish to start fresh, use the Git tags as described above.
